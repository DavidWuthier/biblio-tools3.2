   BiblioTools is a set of python scripts that can be used to analyse bibligraphic data. essentially, the scripts take Web of Science or Scopus bibliographic data files as input and prepare formatted output files that can be used either in (the graph vizualisation tool) Gephi or in (the web interative visualition platform) BiblioMaps.

   BiblioMaps is a set of html / css / javascript files that can be used to deploy an interactive visualisation platform on your (local or remote) website.

   BiblioTools and BiblioMap will allow you to
   ** perform standard statistical (frequency) analysis of the bibliographic items (keywords, subjects, journals, authors, references, etc) of the publications within your corpus and visualize the results in a web interface
   ** prepare standard co-occurrence networks (co-authors, co-citations, heterogeneous networks, etc) to be visualized in Gephi or BiblioMaps
   ** prepare a Bibliographic Coupling analysis: construction of the network, detection of hierarchical topical clusters, interactive visualisation of the resulting clusters.
